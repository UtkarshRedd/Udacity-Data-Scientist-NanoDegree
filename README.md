# Udacity-Data-Scientist-Nanodegree
**File1: StackOverflowEDA**
**File2: Data Scientist prediction**
**File3: survey_results_public.csv is the dataset used**

This project is a part of the Udacity Data scientist nanodgree term 2. The project is based on the StackOverflow 2017 dataset containing the responses of a survey. The dataset has been used to provide an analysis of what a career in Data Science is like, with respect to Job Satisfaction, Career Satisfaction, Salary, skills required, etc. 

Apart from the analysis, a Logistic Regression model has been trained to predict whether someone can become a Data Scientist or not. By analyzing the dataset, it can be observed what skills Data Scientists have in real life (what langauges, frameworks, databases etc they have worked with) what their educational qualifications are like. Using these data points, a model has been made which can predict if one can become a Scientist or not, upon entering the qualifications, skills etc, corresponding to the values similar to the ones in the survey dataset. Although according to the data, people who are Data Scientists also hold other titles like Web Developers, App Developers, etc simultaneously along with the respective skill sets, it still throws light upon what all is needed to become a Data Scientist. That does mean holding different titles too, since Data Science is a very broad field of study.

Moreover, this project highlights what people who are Data Scientists actually do. This project can also be molded to any other title like Web Developers, Mobile Developers etc to find out what it is that they do in real life. This information can prove to be very useful to beginners in a field of study and can highlight key areas for them.


This submission has 2 jupyter notebook files. The StackOverflow EDA file has the analysis of how Data Science is with respect to Job Satisfaction and other criteria. The Prediction notebook has the model which predicts if one can become a Data Scientist or not.
