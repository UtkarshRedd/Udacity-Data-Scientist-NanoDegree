This project is a part of the Udacity Data scientist nanodgree term 2. The project is based on the StackOverflow 2017 dataset containing the responses of a survey. The dataset has been used to provide an analysis of what a career in Data Science is like, with respect to Job Satisfaction, Career Satisfaction, Salary, skills required, etc. 

Apart from the analysis, a Logistic Regression model has been trained to predict whether someone can become a Data Scientist or not. By analyzing the dataset, it can be observed what skills Data Scientists have in real life (what langauges, frameworks, databases etc they have worked with) what their educational qualifications are like. Using these data points, a model has been made which can predict if one can become a Scientist or not, upon entering the qualifications, skills etc, corresponding to the values similar to the ones in the survey dataset. Although according to the data, people who are Data Scientists also hold other titles like Web Developers, App Developers, etc simultaneously along with the respective skill sets, it still throws light upon what all is needed to become a Data Scientist. That does mean holding different titles too, since Data Science is a very broad field of study.

Moreover, this project highlights what people who are Data Scientists actually do. This project can also be molded to any other title like Web Developers, Mobile Developers etc to find out what it is that they do in real life. This information can prove to be very useful to beginners in a field of study and can highlight key areas for them.


**INSTALLATIONS**

* Seaborn 0.11.1

Used Anaconda Distribution and Jupyter Notebooks for Python coding

**Project Motivation**
----
I have been hearing all the hype about Data Science and how cool Data Scientists are, since I was in my first year of University, . I never really understood the real reason behind the hype, until my last year of Uni, when I started learning about Data Science and did a few courses. I took up related electives in Uni and I got a Data Science oriented internship as well. It wasn't long before I got hooked on to it. As a result of the hype and the popularity of the concept, many of my friends and colleagues call themselves “Data Science enthusiasts”, but none of them are sure whether it’s the right career path to follow.
I'm in my last year of University right now and I'm going to start my first job ever in about a month (which is also Data Science oriented). When I was going through the StackOverflow dataset, I was able to find information about developers from various fields of study including Data Science. So, I felt like I've got a chance to find the answer to my question, is Data Science just overhyped? Hence came the idea for this project.

**File Descriptions**
----
This submission has 2 jupyter notebook files. The StackOverflow EDA file has the analysis of how Data Science is with respect to Job Satisfaction and other criteria. The Prediction notebook has the model which predicts if one can become a Data Scientist or not.

**Conclusion of the project**
----
* Data Science is one of the most sought-after jobs, but it is one of the most difficult ones to break into
* Only 4% of the Respondents in the Stack Overflow survey are Data Scientists, which implies that there is huge scope in the industry and the market is far from oversaturation.
* Upon Analysis, the average salary of Data Scientists is $61137 p.a. 20% of the Data Scientists have salaries higher than $100000 with some earning as high as $200000.
* Being a successful Data Scientist is different than being just a Data Scientist. It’s not easy in the beginning. But after successfully obtaining all of the skills and experience required, Data Science can be one of the most rewarding jobs in the world.
* Can you become a Data Scientist? The answer to that lies in the Logistic Regression model in the jupyter notebook. Upon filling in the Technologies and other required fields, it will predict whether one can become a Data Scientist or not (Statistically speaking).
